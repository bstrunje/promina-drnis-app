Analyzing network data
Okay, let's analyze this network request to identify the problem.

Purpose of the Request:

URL: https://promina-drnis-app.vercel.app/profile suggests the user is trying to access their profile page on the "promina-drnis-app" application, which is hosted on Vercel.
Method: While the method is redacted, based on the context, likely the request uses the GET method. It is a common way to retrieve the user's profile information.
Headers:
accept: text/html... indicates the client (browser) expects an HTML response, typical for loading a webpage.
accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd indicates the browser can handle compressed responses, which is good for performance.
user-agent provides browser information, which is normal.
The browser includes multiple headers with the sec- prefix, that provide various security information.
cache-control: max-age=0 shows the browser is not using cached data for this request.
Timing Analysis:

Queuing: 1.09 ms - This is a very short time, suggesting no significant delay before the request started.
Connection start (stalled): 1.56 ms - This is also quite fast.
Request sent: 0.34 ms - Extremely quick, indicating the request was prepared and sent rapidly.
Waiting for server response: 80.99 ms - This is the longest part of the request, although not necessarily slow. It means the server took 80.99ms to send the response.
Content download: 1.13 ms - Very fast, suggesting the response was small, which is consistent with a simple error page.
Duration: 85.12 ms - The total time for the request. Not bad, but the waiting time could be investigated.
Status Code Analysis:

404 Not Found: This is the key indicator of the problem. The server could not find a resource at the /profile path. It could also indicate that user is not logged in and that this page is hidden for unauthenticated users.
Response headers x-vercel-error and x-vercel-id are custom headers related to the Vercel hosting platform. These can be helpful for Vercel to debug the issue.
Problem Identification:

The primary problem is the 404 Not Found status code. The server is indicating that it doesn't have anything to serve at the /profile URL.

Potential causes:

Incorrect URL/Path: There might be a typo in the URL in the application. The path /profile might be incorrect.
Missing Route: The application's backend might not have a defined route or handler for the /profile path.
Deployment Issue: The route definition might have failed to deploy correctly to the Vercel server.
Authentication/Authorization: The profile page might require authentication, and the user might not be logged in. If that is the case, the server could respond with a 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden), or serve a login page. Because 404 is present, we can assume that this is not the issue.
Recommendations:

Verify the URL: Double-check if /profile is indeed the correct URL for the user profile.
Check Server-Side Routing: Inspect the application's backend code or configuration to confirm that a route or handler exists for /profile.
Review Deployment: If the route is confirmed to be correct, check the Vercel deployment logs for any errors or warnings during deployment.
Implement client-side validation: Check if client-side app is sending correct urls.
In summary, the server couldn't find the resource at /profile, leading to a 404 error. The fast timing generally indicates the network isn't the issue, and the problem lies on the server-side or application-level configuration.
