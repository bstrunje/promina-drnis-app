# Global System Manager Guide

**Role:** Global System Manager (GSM)  
**Access:** Cross-organization management  
**Language:** English

---

## üéØ Overview

As a Global System Manager, you can create and manage multiple organizations on the platform. Each organization has its own Organization System Manager (OSM) who handles day-to-day operations.

**Key Distinction:** Your `organization_id` is `null`, which grants you access to manage all organizations.

## üè¢ Organization Management

### Creating a New Organization

**Route:** `POST /api/system-manager/organizations`

When creating an organization, you provide:

1. **Organization Details**:
   - `name` - Full organization name
   - `subdomain` - Unique subdomain (e.g., `promina`)
   - `email` - Organization contact email
   - `phone` - Contact phone number (optional)
   - `address` - Physical address (optional)

2. **Organization System Manager (OSM) Account**:
   - `sm_username` - OSM username
   - `sm_email` - OSM email
   - `sm_password` - Initial OSM password
   - `sm_display_name` - OSM display name (optional)

3. **Branding** (optional):
   - `primary_color` - Main brand color (hex)
   - `secondary_color` - Accent color (hex)

The system will:
- Create the organization
- Automatically create the OSM account
- Set `password_reset_required = true` for the OSM
- OSM must change password on first login

### Viewing Organizations

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between GSM and OSM?
- **GSM (Global System Manager)**: Manages multiple organizations, creates OSM accounts
- **OSM (Organization System Manager)**: Manages a single organization, handles members, settings, and daily operations

### Can I access organization settings?
No, organization-specific settings (2FA, holidays, duty calendar, etc.) are managed by each Organization System Manager.

### Can I manage members directly?
No, member management is handled by the Organization System Manager of each organization.

### What happens when I create an organization?
The system creates the organization and automatically creates an OSM account with the credentials you provide. The OSM will be required to change their password on first login.

### How do I help an OSM who forgot their password?
Use the "Reset OSM Password" function to generate a new temporary password for them.
