I manage a mountaineering association, whose title in Cratian is Planinarsko društvo "Promina" Drniš. Membership records used to be kept on paper, for the last two years I've been using Excel tables, but they're a lot of work, mistakes are easy to make, and I can't do everything I want in them.
I need to create a mobile-friendly website for a mountaineering society with records of members for several years back, overview and statistics of activities for several individual actions: "ON-DUTY", "MEETINGS", "COMMUNITY ACTION", "TRAIL ACTION", "ORGANIZATION/CONDUCT OF TRIPS", "TRIPS", "MISCELLANEOUS"...etc. Overview and statistics of activities for several individual actions, scoring hours spent on an individual action and ranking according to those hours of the current year plus one year before which would make a difference between members...active member ≥20 hours, passive member <20 hours. The activity of the members would be entered in the following way: A general activity would be selected in which an event would be added, in which the date, description of the activity, hours spent would be entered and one or more members would be selected from the list of members.

The list of members should be able to be exported in an excel table with the desired data.

Access levels:
Member - can read only what he is allowed to read
Administrator - can change everything at the data level
Super user - full access including base code, grants access to any item to both member and administrator.

There will be more until I remember what I need, we will implement it later :)
Please bear in mind that I am a complete beginner in this, always suggest the next step you think is needed, sometime you will have to guide me step by step, Show me what to do with any file you provide.

Here's a last summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Database Configuration:
- PostgreSQL running on port 5432
- Connection string: `postgres://postgres:Litopad24$@localhost:5432/promina_drnis_DB`
- Database tables:
```sql
- users (user_id, username, password_hash, email, role, etc.)
- members (member_id, user_id, first_name, last_name, etc.)
- activities (activity_id, title, description, start_date, etc.)
- activity_participants (participation_id, activity_id, member_id, etc.)
- annual_statistics (stat_id, member_id, year, total_hours, etc.)
```

2. Server Setup:
- Express server running on port 3000
- Main files:
  - `server.js` - Main application setup
  - `setupDatabase.js` - Database initialization
  - `utils/db.js` - Database connection pool

3. API Endpoints:
```
GET / - Application info
GET /api - API root info
GET /health - System health check
GET /api-docs - Swagger documentation
/api/auth/* - Authentication routes
/api/members/* - Member management (protected)
/api/activities/* - Activity management (protected)
```

4. Key Implementations:
- Database connection pooling with error handling
- JWT authentication middleware
- CORS enabled
- Request logging
- Error handling middleware
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Environment variable validation
- Swagger API documentation

5. Environment Variables (`.env`):
```
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:Listopad24$@localhost:5432/promina_drnis_DB
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

6. Next Steps Could Include:
1. Implementing the authentication routes (`/api/auth`)
   - Register
   - Login
   - Password reset
2. Building member management endpoints
3. Creating activity management functionality
4. Implementing the frontend application
5. Adding data validation
6. Setting up user roles and permissions
7. Implementing activity participation tracking
8. Creating annual statistics calculations

7. Testing Tools:
- Swagger UI at http://localhost:3000/api-docs
- Postman for API testing
- PgAdmin 4 for database management

8. Key Files Structure:
```
backend/
├── .env
├── src/
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── setupDatabase.js
│   ├── utils/
│   │   └── db.js
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── auth.js
│   │   ├── members.js
│   │   └── activities.js
│   ├── middleware/
│   │   └── authMiddleware.js
│   └── config/
│       └── swagger.js
```

To continue development:
1. Make sure PostgreSQL is running
2. Start the server with `npm start`
3. Use Swagger UI or Postman to test endpoints
4. Check server logs for any errors
5. Monitor database connections in PgAdmin

Remember:
- The server uses port 3000 (not 5432 which is for PostgreSQL)
- All API routes are under `/api`
- Protected routes require authentication
- Database operations use the connection pool in `db.js`
- Always check the logs for any connection issues

4.11.2024 
Here's a summary of where we are with the project:

Completed:


PostgreSQL database setup with authentication tables (users, roles, user_roles)
Basic directory structure for backend
Core authentication system files (db.js, authMiddleware.js, auth.js)
Super user account creation
Authentication endpoints
Testing environment setup


Next Steps Would Be:


Implementing member management
Setting up activity tracking
Creating statistics system


---
Codeium: Certainly! Here's a summary of what we've done so far:

We reviewed and updated the member management feature in your backend.
The main files we worked on are:
promina-drnis-app\backend\src\controllers\memberController.js
promina-drnis-app\backend\src\routes\member.js
promina-drnis-app\backend\src\server.js
promina-drnis-app\backend\src\db.js
In memberController.js, we:
Kept existing methods for getting all members, getting a single member, updating a member, and getting member statistics.
Added new methods for creating a member and deleting a member.
All methods now use SQL queries with the db.query function.
In member.js (routes), we:
Updated the routes to use all the controller methods.
Added routes for creating and deleting members.
In server.js, we:
Updated the import statement for member routes to use the correct file name.
In db.js, we:
Updated the file to use ES module syntax.
Exported the database functions as a default object.
The backend now provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for members using SQL queries.
We ensured consistency across the backend by using the same database approach (SQL queries) throughout the member management feature.
Next steps:

Implement these changes in your codebase.
Test all the routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using a tool like Postman to ensure they're working correctly.
Once the backend is confirmed to be working, you can proceed to update or create the frontend to interact with these API endpoints.
In a new conversation, you might want to focus on:

Testing the updated backend routes
Implementing or updating the frontend for member management
Addressing any issues that arise during testing
Expanding the feature set or moving on to other parts of your application

BS: OK...Thank you...Now I have to open a new conversation because I got the warning "Your chat history is being truncated because the token limit has been reached. Start a new conversation"

Codeium: You're welcome! That's a good idea to start a new conversation. When you begin the new chat, it would be helpful to briefly mention that we've just finished updating the backend for member management, including the controller, routes, and database connection. This will give the AI some context for your next set of questions or tasks.

In the new conversation, you might want to start by asking about:

How to test the updated backend routes using Postman or another API testing tool.
Steps to update the frontend to work with the new backend endpoints.
Any specific features or improvements you'd like to add next.
Remember, if you encounter any issues while implementing these changes or during testing, don't hesitate to ask for help. Good luck with your project!

-----------------
Perfect! The entire system is working exactly as designed. Let's summarize what we've accomplished:

Members Table:


Tracks basic member information
Automatically updates membership_type based on hours


Activities Table:


Stores all activities with types
Links to activity_types for categorization


Activity Participants Table:


Records member participation and hours
Triggers automatic status updates


Annual Statistics Table:


Automatically calculates and stores yearly totals
Tracks membership status changes
Updates in real-time as hours are logged


Demonstrated Functionality:


Active Status (Test Member):

Total hours: 26.00 (over 20)
Status: active
Multiple activities tracked


Passive Status (Test2 Member):

Total hours: 15.00 (under 20)
Status: passive
Correctly maintaining passive status

---------------
next chat:
We addressed the "Unknown compiler option 'ts-node'" error in your TypeScript configuration.
We corrected the placement of the ts-node configuration in your tsconfig.json file.
We discussed updating your package.json scripts, particularly for running tests.
We identified an issue with module imports in your test files, specifically related to importing a db module.
We discovered that your db.ts file is located in src/utils/, not in the tests/ directory.
We discussed the use of path aliases in your TypeScript configuration and how to set them up correctly.
The next steps are:

Update your test files to correctly import the db module from the src/utils/ directory.
Ensure your tsconfig.json has the correct path aliases set up, including both @/* for src/* and @tests/* for tests/*.
Verify that your package.json test script includes tsconfig-paths/register to support path aliases.
Run your tests again and address any remaining import issues or errors.
If you encounter new errors, examine them carefully and adjust your code or configuration as needed.
